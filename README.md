# Adventure-Game-Level-Design
This project was developed during the level design module on my university course. The aim of this specific assessment was to develop a 5-10 minute level for an adventrure game like 'the last of us' or 'uncharted'.

The gameplay we used to create the levels was from the advanced locomotive system from the unreal asset store (https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-locomotion-system-v1).
The AI for use within the levels was created by Kai Ismay, one of the masters students at that time.

If you wish for an explanation into the process of developing the level, you can watch a video with voice over here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwyxuDb7WX8

Or you can read the 'level design writeup' document, ignoring the first paragraph as the writeup was a joint document and my part starts part way down the first page of the uploaded file.
